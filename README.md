# BLASTer v.4
A tool for examining sequence conservation in proteins.
April 20, 2020

BLASTer is a tool which automates a workflow for identifying homologs of
proteins, examining their conservation across different species, and
generating useful alignments and tables for publication. It is basically
automation of what I want to know about any protein I plan on working with.

Based on Python 2 code previously found in scripts BLASTer_v3.3.py and
align-o-tron2002.py. (Both of which date from ~2016.) Developed on a Mac
with OSX 10.15.4.

Dependencies:
  Python 3.8.2
  Biopython 1.76
  matplotlib 3.2.1
  MUSCLE 3.8.31 (www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm)
  BLAST+ 2.10.0 (ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)
  Logomaker 0.8 (Tareen & Kinney 2019 Bioinformatics btz921. bioRxiv doi:10.1101/6

I recommend reading the BLASTer Tutorial PDF for instructions on how to use
this software.

Finally, while I certainly hope this is useful for you, and I would love to
hear from anyone about how they use this code, I am not a professional
software developer and cannot commit to tech support or regular updates.
This means BLASTer may well break as the underlying modules are updated
and revised.

That being said, please feel free to contact me at mjgray@uab.edu
